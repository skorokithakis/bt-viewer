- When getting a new requirement, make sure you change docs/PRD.md to include it.
- docs/PRD.md should be considered the source of truth. When the implementation in the
  code doesn't match docs/PRD.md, ask which is correct and update the one that is wrong.
- There is a server running at http://localhost:8000 and you can use the Playwright MCP
  to test your changes without asking.
